# UFOs
## Overview 
Dana would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. We need to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape, in addition to date.  

## Results

Since we have now made the event listener change, as soon as the new filter is applied the table should look for the appropriate criteria. This type of technology can be applied to help anybody sort through the large dataset without having to know anything about coding themselves. This code even allows for multiple filters to be used at the same time. If you wanted to know what sightings there were on 1/10/2010 in CA, USA. The filters will allow you to do so.  

## Summary 

One drawback from this website is that it does not specify what filters are available in the dataset. For example, not every country is on the dataset. Searching a country that is not there could lead people to assume there were never any sightings in that country. I recommend providing a dropdown list of the possible filters to clear up the availability. And I also recommend adding a filter for finding specific words in the comment section.
